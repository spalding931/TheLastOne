This repo started with `create-react-app` and you can read that full README [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md).

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` after cloning the repo.

Run `npm start` each time you work locally.

If a dependency fails or is missing, try running `npm install` again.

Run `npm run deploy` to compile to the `build` directory and upload the compiled files with Firebase.
